    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>GeoConcert is a web application that allows you to find future concerts from your favorite artists on a map.</p>
    <h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        GeoConcert asks Spotify for your favorite artists and then asks about those artists
        to the TicketMaster database. Then, it takes that information and renders it in a 
        Google Map so you can see where your favorite artists are playing, anywhere in
        the world!
    </p>
    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Select one of your favorite artists to see when and where they will play on a Google Map!</li>
        <li>You can filter the artists by the dates you are interested in.</li>
        <li>You can select only one, a few, or even all of your favorite artists!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="data-and-privacy">Data and Privacy</h2>
