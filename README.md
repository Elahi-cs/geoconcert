#### Description:
GeoConcert is a web app that allows you to find concerts for your favorite artists on a world map.

## About

GeoConcert asks Spotify for your favorite artists and then asks about those artists to the TicketMaster database. Then, it takes that information and renders it in a Google Map so you can see where your favorite artists are playing, anywhere in the world!

## Features

* Select one of your favorite artists to see when and where they will play on a Google Map!
* You can filter the artists by the dates you are interested in.
* You can select only one, a few, or even all of your favorite artists!

## Planned Features

These are the features that are waiting to be developed at some point in the future:

* Search for artist concerts using a search bar.
* Hide/toggle artist markers in the map.
